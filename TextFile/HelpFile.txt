Head: This is helping center, you can find the word explanation of all parameter asked you to put in, some are followed with example
Simulator: There are two kinds of simulator, one is using bacteria scan the surface of film to calculate the energy,\n other one is dynamic simulate bacteria movement on the film
Type: Simulation type can be 1 or 2 or 3 for now \n1 for one surface react with one bacteria once \n2 for One surface, multiple different bacteria, every bacteria scan the surface once \n3 for Multiple different surface, one bacteria, bacteria scan every surface once \nDifferent bacteria/surface means the domain generation seed is different, not the size different
Trail: Trail number for this simulation
Seed: Seed number for generate the position of domain on the surface
Dimension: Dimension of simulation, for now only can be 2D, type the number of dimension
SurfaceShape: Shape of surface
DomainShape: Shape of domain
Size: Size of surface want to generate, in the format ###x###, in the unit um, 1micrometer (um) = 100 points
Charge: Total charge of the surface, -1 for negative, 0 for neutral, 1 for positive
Concentration: Concentration of domain on the surface or the positive charge in the domain on the surface
Number: Number of film/bacteria want to test, for simulation type 2 and 3 use
Interval: Interval is how many times scan on x/y direction
Timestep: Time step is how many step want to simulate, in one timestep, all bacteria loop once and calculate and update once
ProbabilityType: Probability uses for bacteria when decide will bacteria stuck on the film or not, can be Poisson or Boltzmann for now
InteractType: Way of calculating energy, can be dot calculate or cut-off calculate
Cutoff: A value, if the distance between point on the bacteria and point on the film exceed this value, then the interact between these two point will not be calculated
