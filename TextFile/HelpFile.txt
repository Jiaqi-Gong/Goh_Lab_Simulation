Head: This is helping center, you can find the word explanation of all parameter asked you to put in, some are followed with example
Type: Simulation type can be 1 or 2 or 3 for now \n1 for one surface react with one bacteria once \n2 for One surface, multiple different bacteria, every bacteria scan the surface once \n 3 for Multiple different surface, one bacteria, bacteria scan every surface once \n Different bacteria/surface means the domain generation seed is different, not the size different
Trail: Trail number for this simulation
Seed: Seed number for generate the poaition of domain on the surface
Dimension: Dimension of simulation, for now only can be 2D, type the number of dimension
Shape: shape of surface/domain
Size: Size of surface want to generate, in the format ###x###, in the unit um, 1micrometer (um) = 100 points
Charge: Total charge of the surface, -1 for negative, 0 for neutral, 1 for positive
Concentration: Concentration of positive charge in the domain on the surface
Number: Number of film/bacteria want to test, for simulation type 2 and 3 use
Interval: Interval is how many times scan on x/y direction
