Head: Record the special requirement for some user input parameter : Here is string for checking code will be exec
Type: Only can be 1 or 2 or 3 for now \n1 for one surface react with one bacteria once \n2 for One surface, multiple different bacteria, every bacteria scan the surface once \n 3 for Multiple different surface, one bacteria, bacteria scan every surface once \n Different bacteria/surface means the domain generation seed is different, not the size different : simulationType in ["1", "2", "3"]
Trail: No restriction: True
Dimension: Dimension only can be 2 or 3 : dimension=="2" or dimension=="3"
Seed: Positive number: seed > "0"
Shape: Only can be single, cross, circle, diamond, octagon : shape in ["SINGLE", "CROSS", "CIRCLE", "DIAMOND", "OCTAGON"]
Diamond: Length and width of the diamond should be same : length==width
Cross: No restrictions : True
Octagon: Length and width of the octagon must be the same : length==width
Single: No restrictions : True
Size: No restriction : True
Charge: Only can be -1, 0, 1 : charge in ["-1", "0", "1"]
Concentration: A positive float between 0 to 1 : concentration <= "1" and concentration >= "0"
Number: Number of film/bacteria should be a positive int : number > "0"
Interval: Number should between 1 to 100 for now: interval >= ("1","1") and interval <= ("100", "100")
