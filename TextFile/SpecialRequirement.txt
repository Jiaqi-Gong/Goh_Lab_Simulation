Head: Record the special requirement for some user input parameter : Here is string for checking code will be exec
Type: Only can be 1 or 2 or 3 for now \n1 for one surface react with one bacteria once \n2 for One surface, multiple different bacteria, every bacteria scan the surface once \n3 for Multiple different surface, one bacteria, bacteria scan every surface once \nDifferent bacteria/surface means the domain generation seed is different, not the size different : simulationType in ["1", "2", "3"]
Trail: Trail number must be a positive int number : trail > "0"
Dimension: Dimension only can be 2 or 3 : dimension=="2" or dimension=="3"
Seed: Positive number: seed > "0"
SurfaceShape: Only can be rectangle for now: shape.upper() in ["RECTANGLE"]
DomainShape: Only can be single, cross, circle, diamond, octagon : shape.upper() in ["SINGLE", "CROSS", "CIRCLE", "DIAMOND", "OCTAGON"]
Diamond: Length and width of the diamond should be same : length==width
Rectangle: No restrictions : True
Cross: No restrictions : True
Octagon: Length and width of the octagon must be the same : length==width
Single: No restrictions : True
Size: No restriction : True
Charge: Only can be -1, 0, 1 : charge in ["-1", "0", "1"]
Concentration: A positive float between 0 to 1 : concentration <= "1" and concentration >= "0"
Number: Number of film/bacteria should be a positive int : number > "0"
Interval: Number should between 1 to 100 for now: int(interval[0]) >= 1 and int(interval[0]) <= 100 and int(interval[1]) >= 0 and int(interval[1]) <= 100
