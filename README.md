# Surface Simulation

This program is surface interaction simulator,
reformed and improved based on <https://github.com/stanlo229/surface-simulation-goh-lab> with permission.

## Overview of the program

1. This program asked the user to input some parameters shown later.
2. Based on the user input, film and bacteria will be generated domain on it, the number of each depends on the simulation type.
3. For energy scan mode, the program will use bacteria to scan the film surface and calculate the energy. (For now, will change in the future)  
4. For dynamic simulation mode, the program will move bacteria and stick/unstuck bacteria on the surface.
5. Result will be saved into an Excel file.

## Overall goal of simulation

1. Purpose
   The overarching goal of this project is to determine how bacteria, yeast, and cells interact with surfaces/films. Due to the small scale of these organisms, distribution of positive, negative, and neutral charges would often affect the interaction between these microorganisms and the film.

2. Introduction to the simulation
   Let's consider the image above. A uniformly charged film and bacteria would give a pretty simple interaction. Similarly, if the charges are patterned, the interaction would also be pretty easy to predict. However, when the charges are scattered on both the film and bacteria, the interaction can be hard to determine. This is where the simulation comes into play; to create a better understanding of these interactions between the film and microorganisms.

   The simulation can be broken down into 2 major sections. There is a static simulation, and dynamic simulation.

3. Static simulation
   The static simulation was developed in continuation of Stanely Loâ€™s work with permission which can be found here: <https://github.com/stanlo229/surface-simulation-goh-lab>

   The objective of this simulation is to replicate how a bacterium interacts with a heterogeneous film through its positive and negative charged coatings. By introducing negative and positive domains on the film and bacteria, we want to determine how controlling the size of the domain affects the interaction between the bacterium and the film. After each run, an optimum location for the bacteria will be calculated based on the positive and negative charges on the bacteria and surface of a film.

4. Dynamic simulation
   The dynamic simulation is a newly created simulation, which looks at how the
