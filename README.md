# Surface Simulation

This program is surface interaction simulator,
reformed and improved based on <https://github.com/stanlo229/surface-simulation-goh-lab> with permission.

## Overview of the program

1. This program asked the user to input some parameters shown later.
2. Based on the user input, film and bacteria will be generated domain on it, the number of each depends on the simulation type.
3. For energy scan mode, the program will use bacteria to scan the film surface and calculate the energy. (For now, will change in the future)  
4. For dynamic simulation mode, the program will move bacteria and stick/unstuck bacteria on the surface.
5. Result will be saved into an Excel file.

## Installation of Python and Required Packages

1. Install python

* Open <https://www.python.org/> to download the python and install.

2. Install required package

* Using following command to install all required package automatically

 ```bash
 python -m pip install -r RequiredPackage.txt
 ```

 If failed, then install all packages manually as below shows

* Open RequiredPackage.txt and use pip to install all requirement package manually, command shows below, XXX replaced by the package name:

 ```bash
 pip install XXX
 ```

* If you do not have pip installed, make sure you download Python 3 from the official
   website: <https://www.python.org/downloads/>

## Run the program

### prerequisite

1. The description of all parameter want user to input is illustrated in the file HelpFile.txt under folder TextFile.  
   User can open and read the meaning of all parameter put in at here or type help or click help when running the
   program depends on how you run the program.  
   The format of HelpFile is: VariableName : Description

2. The special restriction of some variables are listed in the file SpecialRequirement.txt under folder TextFile.  
   The message listed in the file will appear on the screen if you type wrong parameter. The format of SpecialRequirement is :
   VariableName: Restriction : Checking condition  
   User don't need to understand the checking condition at the end and should NOT change it.

3. The parameter change from the old version is listed in the file OldNewTransfer.txt.  
   If need to reproduce the result from the old version, please look at this file.

### Parameters illustrate

1. Log parameters (set at the beginning of the simulation):

* writeImage: boolean, generate result image or not

* recordLog: boolean, generate log file or not
* writeAtLast: boolean, generate all log file after simulation is done or not
* printMessage: boolean, show running message in the terminal or not

2. Simulator parameters:

* SimulationType: int,  can be 1 or 2 or 3 for now, 1 for one surface react with one bacteria once, 2 for One surface, multiple different bacteria, every bacteria scan the surface once, 3 for Multiple different surfaces, one bacteria, bacteria scan every surface once. Different bacteria/surface means the domain generation seed is different, not the size different
* trail: int, trail number
* dimension: int, dimension of simulation, only can be 2 or 3, for dynamic simulation, only can be 3
* simulatorType: int, 1 for energy scan mode and 2 for dynamic simulation mode

*

### Running simulation

1. Run by user input in command line:
   * In the terminal with correct directory of program code, type in

* (For macOS)

  ```bash
   python3 RunSimulationCmd.py
   ```

* (For Windows)

   ```bash
   python3.exe RunSimulationCmd.py
   ```

* Follow the promotion in the terminal to type in the corresponding value to start the simulation.

2. Run by script (Coming soon)

### Result

Result of the simulation will be saved in the folder Result in energy folder or dynamic folder

### Extra Info

* The log of running will be saved under folder Log. If error happen, user may look at the log file to figure out the error.

### Overall goal of simulation

1. Purpose
The overarching goal of this project is to determine how bacteria, yeast, and cells interact with surfaces/films. Due to the small scale of these organisms, distribution of positive, negative, and neutral charges would often affect the interaction between these microorganisms and the film.

2. Introduction to the simulation
Let's consider the image down below. A uniformly charged film and bacteria would give a pretty simple interaction. Similarly, if the charges are patterned, the interaction would also be pretty easy to predict. However, when the charges are scattered on both the film and bacteria, the interaction can be hard to determine. This is where the simulation comes into play; to create a better understanding of these interactions between the film and microorganisms.

The simulation can be broken down into 2 major sections. There is a static simulation, and dynamic simulation.

3. Static simulation
The static simulation was developed in continuation of Stanely Loâ€™s work with permission which can be found here: <https://github.com/stanlo229/surface-simulation-goh-lab>

The objective of this simulation is to replicate how a bacterium interacts with a heterogeneous film through its positive and negative charged coatings. By introducing negative and positive domains on the film and bacteria, we want to determine how controlling the size of the domain affects the interaction between the bacterium and the film. After each run, an optimum location for the bacteria will be calculated based on the positive and negative charges on the bacteria and surface of a film.

4. Dynamic simulation
The dynamic simulation is a newly created simulation, which looks at how the
